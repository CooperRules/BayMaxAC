First of all you'll need to invite Baymax on your Discord server by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=339074916127080469&scope=bot&permissions=3072)

Once the bot is added to the server type in the channel you want the warnings to be at the command **--baymaxRegister** _(You need to have the administrator permission)_

_If you want to change the channel type **--baymaxChangeChannel** in the wanted channel_

You will then receive a Direct Message with the **key** you need to enter in the **config.yml**

Go to the Baymax **config.yml** and put the give key in the **discord-bot-key** field like so : `discord-bot-key: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"`
